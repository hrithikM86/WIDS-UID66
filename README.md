# Precipitation prediction using Machine Learning

The project aims to teach you the basics of machine learning and how to use it to create a machine learning model that can predict precipitation. This project is aimed at students who want to begin their career and are looking for a starting point. We will start right from the basics and move towards advanced concepts.

## Problem Statement 

To create a model that can predict whether precipitation occurs or not using various machine learning algorithms.

### [Week 1: Introduction to tools used in Machine Learning](<./Week 1/>)
This week will be a lighter one for those already familiar with Python. For those who are new, we have got you covered. 
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) : Watch till 3:36:00, try to write the code and try running them, this goes for all further tutorials 
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
- [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZOOLe2imFo)

Assignment : Test your Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib concepts
- [W1_Assignment1](<./Week 1/Assignment_1.ipynb>) 
- [W1_Assignment1 dataset](<./Week 1/countries.csv>)
- [W1_Assignment submission](https://forms.gle/gP2VYsneNXSDYWgz6)
- Upload the Assignment and Dataset on Google Collab and solve. For downloading individual files form Github use "GitZip for github" chrome extension

### [Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning](<./Week 2/>)
- [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
- [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
- Apply for financial aid for these courses, and while applying, audit the course for free. Watch the videos at 2x speed; no need to complete assignments. By auditing the course, you can immediately access the videos for free without waiting for financial aid approval.

### [Week 3.1: Deep Diving into Machine Learning](<./Week 3/>)
This week, we will review the key concepts covered in week 2 and delve into coding for the machine learning algorithms introduced during that time and begin with our final project.
