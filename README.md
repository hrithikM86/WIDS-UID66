# Precipitation prediction using ML

The project aims to teach you the basics of machine learning and how to use it to create a machine learning model that can predict precipitation. This project is aimed at students who want to begin their career and are looking for a starting point. We will start right from the basics and move towards advanced concepts.

## Problem Statement 

To create a model that can predict whether precipitation occurs or not using various machine learning algorithms.

## Project Phases

### [Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Python](<./Week 1/>)
This week will be a lighter one for those already familiar with Python. For those who are new, we have got you covered. 
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) : Watch till 3:36:00, try to write the code and try running them, this goes for all further tutorials 
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
- [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZOOLe2imFo)

NOTE
- You can use other sources which you are comfortable with, just make sure to learn Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib till the end of Week 1. 
- Also only watching the videos won’t give you much idea if you don’t code it up yourself. 
- Try using Google Collab (highly recommended rather than VScode or Jyputer notebook ) to code. 
- These are the basic tools to get started, obviously there are various other useful libraries, but learning them at once doesn't make any sense. We will learn whatever extra need
- Apply for financial aid for all three courses in [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) and audit them. We won’t be dealing with this course during this project, but it’s a good one to get started with ML and you can complete this course after completing this project

Assignment : Test your Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib concepts
