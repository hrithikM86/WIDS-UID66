# Precipitation prediction using ML

The project aims to teach you the basics of machine learning and how to use it to create a machine learning model that can predict precipitation. This project is aimed at students who want to begin their career and are looking for a starting point. We will start right from the basics and move towards advanced concepts.

## Problem Statement 

To create a model that can predict whether precipitation occurs or not using various machine learning algorithms.

## Project Phases

### [Week 1: Introduction to tools used in Machine Learning](<./Week 1/>)
This week will be a lighter one for those already familiar with Python. For those who are new, we have got you covered. 
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) : Watch till 3:36:00, try to write the code and try running them, this goes for all further tutorials 
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
- [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZOOLe2imFo)

Assignment : Test your Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib concepts
- [W1_Assignment1](<./Week 1/Assignment_1.ipynb>) 
- [W1_Assignment1 dataset](<./Week 1/countries.csv>)
- Upload the Assignment and Dataset on Google Collab and solve. For downloading individual files form Github use "GitZip for github" chrome extension
